Description
0-30v 0-10A Variable Power Supply Adjustable Voltage and Current
0-30v 0-10A Variable Power Supply Adjustable Voltage and Current



Variable power supply with both voltage & current control 1-30 volts and 0-10A.

Both voltage and current can be controlled with Potentiometers, Multi-turn potentiometers is good for high precision settings. Where output load should be under 10 Amperes.

And required big heatsink with cooling fan for effective cooling.

Also required DC Volt Ampere meter to monitor the output.



Parts Required_____

TIP3055 & BD139 Transistors

LM7805 & LM317 voltage regulators

10k, 220 ohms resistors + 1 LED

10k Multi-turn potentiometers

2x 1N4007 diodes

1x 5v dc cooling fan

1x DC volt cum Ampere meter
